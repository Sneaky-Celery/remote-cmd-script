    A function that connects to a remote server and executes a list of commands sequentially.

    Parameters:
    - host: A string containing the IP address or hostname of the remote server.
    - commands: A list of strings containing the commands to execute on the remote server.
    - username: A string containing the username to use for the SSH connection.
    - password: A string containing the password to use for the SSH connection.

    Returns:
    - A list of strings, where each string contains the standard output of a command.
